Algorithm : 
Imagine an array representing multiple local neighborhoods, each containing individuals with different rankings.
Traverse through each neighborhood, considering a specified range (K) at a time.
Within each range, find  the individual with the highest ranking.
Print the ranking.
Move to the next neighborhood, overlapping with the previous one.
Repeat the process until you have covered all neighborhoods.
The printed rankings represent the local champions within each specified range in the neighborhoods.
